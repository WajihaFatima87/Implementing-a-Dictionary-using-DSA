# Implementing-a-Dictionary-using-DSA

MyDictionary is a C++ console-based dictionary application that reads data from a CSV file containing words, their meanings, and example sentences. It stores the data in a hash table for fast lookup and provides a simple menu interface to:

🔍 Find the meaning of a word

💬 View or add example sentences

⭐ Add/remove words from a favorites list

📄 Display favorite words (optionally sorted)

The project demonstrates file handling, data structures (hash tables, linked lists), and user interaction in C++.
